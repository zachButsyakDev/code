<h1>Campus Life</h1>

    <p>Despite what some might tell you, the UNO campus is actually pretty alive.</p>
    <p>I feel like UNO does a pretty good job of actually preparing young adults for real life, as having to get out there actually takes effort</p>
    <p>and will quickly break any expectations that social events will just happen around you without effort.</p>
    <p>So while UNO's campus might not exactly be the party school some people might be looking for, there are absolutely things to do.</p>
    <p>It just takes some effort. But you can do it, I believe in you :).</p>
