    <h1>Class Registration</h1>
    <p>There isn't alot to this one. You'll be guided through how to sign up for classes really well during your orientation, and definitely way better than I can explain.</p>
    <p>Only tips I can give here are making sure that you double check with your advisor with everything, or try sitting down with them and just drafting a semester-by-semester schedule if possible.</p>
    <p>Degree works is your best friend here. It tells you exactly what classes fulfill what credit requirements. Use it.</p>
