    <h1>Dorming</h1>
    <h2><a href="https://www.unomaha.edu/student-life/housing-and-residential-life/prospective-students/on-campus-residence-halls/index.php">Click here to access information on dorming</a></h2>
    <p>I'll be completely honest: I don't know much about the dorms.</p>
    <p>But, from what I've heard, the studio dorms are the way to go. Really cheap, even for dorms. So if you're looking to dorm here at UNO, gun for those.</p>
    <p>Dorm room etiquette? I'll be totally honest, I don't know. Cause I don't live in one. But watch this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwt0iHe8SSY">here</a>, it looks like he has it figured out.</p>
