    <p>Scholarships and other kinds of financial aid available at UNO are extremely important and can really help with the affordability</p>
    <p>The linked website lists the different kinds of scholarships available as well as their application process, expectations, rewards, and deadlines.</p>
    <p>It is important to not slack on these! I've personally been bit in the butt by delaying my scholarship applications and missing deadlines. Don't be like me!</p>
