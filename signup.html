<h4>How to Enroll:</h4>
<p>Enrolling to UNO can be pretty daunting. However, that's why my awesome UNO guide is here for you.</p>
<p>There's a decent list of things you'll need to provide, These include...</p>
<ol>
    <li>Highschool Transcript/GED Score</li>
    <li>ACT/SAT Scores</li>
    <li>Financial Information</li>
    <li>Additional information regarding background</li>
    <li><del>your soul</del></li>
<p>Compared to most schools, UNO's registration is pretty simple. However, if you need to, schedule a meeting with an advisor to help with the process </p>
<p>Once you're done, you should receive your email either confirming or denying your enrollment application. Good luck!</p>
