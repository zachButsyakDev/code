    <h1>Handy-Dandy Tips to Survive</h1>
    <p>Just some general information to help get you through your first semester once you're enrolled.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>GO TO YOUR LECTURES. I promise you, if you're in a tough class, going to every lecture is worth it. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Try to get involved in clubs. They can really help make you feel like an actual college student and not just some random guy bumbling through your classes.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>I don't care who you are, what GPA you had in HS, or what AP classes you took, study. It's like, actually useful.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the mentors or tutors! They're literally here to help you.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't try to have a side-project while you're doing your classes. Get your classes done first, and then absolutely hammer down a side project during breaks.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't stress too much on internships. Wait until you've gotten about halfway through your school. Companies won't choose you to be an intern if you're still in intro to comp-sci.</li>
    </ul>
